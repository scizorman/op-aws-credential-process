# op-aws-credential-process

AWS credential_process implementation that retrieves credentials from 1Password with MFA session caching.

This tool retrieves IAM credentials stored in 1Password, performs MFA authentication, and obtains temporary credentials via AWS STS.
It implements the `credential_process` protocol, making it compatible with not only the AWS CLI but also Terraform, boto3, and any other tool that uses the AWS SDK.
Temporary credentials are cached per profile and reused until expiration.

## Requirements

- **Unix-like OS** (Linux, macOS) — Uses `/dev/tty` for MFA input
- **1Password CLI (`op`) v2** — Used to retrieve credentials
- **AWS Account** — Requires an IAM user with an MFA device

## Installation

### Download from GitHub Release

Download the binary for your platform from the latest release.

https://github.com/scizorman/op-aws-credential-process/releases

### go install

Requires Go 1.25+.

```bash
go install github.com/scizorman/op-aws-credential-process@latest
```

## Setup

### 1Password

#### Setting up the op CLI

If desktop app integration is enabled, the `op` CLI will unlock via biometric authentication automatically, requiring no manual sign-in.
If integration is disabled, you must sign in manually with `eval $(op signin)`.

#### Storing AWS credentials

Store your AWS credentials in 1Password.

By default, the tool expects the Access Key ID in the `Access key ID` field and the Secret Access Key in the `Secret access key` field.
Field names can be customized via `--op-access-key-id-field` and `--op-secret-access-key-field` flags.

### AWS CLI

Configure `~/.aws/config` as follows:

```ini
[profile example]
region = ap-northeast-1
mfa_serial = arn:aws:iam::123456789012:mfa/user
credential_process = op-aws-credential-process --op-vault <vault> --op-item <item>
```

`mfa_serial` is the ARN of the MFA device assigned to your IAM user.
`credential_process` specifies the command line for op-aws-credential-process.

#### WSL

On WSL, you can use the Windows-side 1Password CLI by specifying the path with `--op-cli-path`:

```ini
[profile example]
region = ap-northeast-1
mfa_serial = arn:aws:iam::123456789012:mfa/user
credential_process = op-aws-credential-process --op-vault <vault> --op-item <item> --op-cli-path /mnt/c/Program\ Files/1Password\ CLI/op.exe
```

This allows you to leverage Windows Hello biometric authentication from WSL.

#### Cross-account access with AssumeRole

Currently, this tool performs `GetSessionToken` to obtain MFA-authenticated temporary credentials.
For cross-account access, combine this with AWS CLI's `source_profile` and `role_arn` settings.

**Example configuration**:

```ini
# Base profile using credential_process
[profile base]
region = ap-northeast-1
mfa_serial = arn:aws:iam::111111111111:mfa/user
credential_process = op-aws-credential-process --op-vault <vault> --op-item <item>

# Cross-account profile using AssumeRole
[profile cross-account]
region = ap-northeast-1
source_profile = base
role_arn = arn:aws:iam::222222222222:role/CrossAccountRole
```

The AWS CLI will first retrieve temporary credentials from the `base` profile, then use them to assume the role specified in `role_arn`.

#### External MFA token provider

By default, this tool prompts for the MFA code interactively via `/dev/tty`.
With `--mfa-process`, you can instead retrieve the code from an external command, such as `ykman` for a YubiKey:

```ini
[profile example]
region = ap-northeast-1
mfa_serial = arn:aws:iam::123456789012:mfa/user
credential_process = op-aws-credential-process --op-vault <vault> --op-item <item> --mfa-process "ykman oath accounts code --single <issuer>"
```

The command is run via `/bin/sh -c`, and must write only the MFA token to stdout.
Leading/trailing whitespace and a trailing newline are ignored, but any other whitespace in the output is treated as invalid.
A non-zero exit status is treated as a failure.
The command's stderr is passed through to the terminal, so prompts such as a YubiKey touch request are still visible.

**Security note**: avoid using a TOTP stored in the same 1Password item as the AWS credentials, e.g. `--mfa-process "op item get ... --otp"`.
Doing so collapses MFA into a single factor, since anyone who can read the IAM credentials from 1Password can also read the TOTP.
MFA is only effective when the token comes from a separate device, such as a YubiKey.

## Usage

### CLI Options

| Flag | Default | Required | Description |
|------|---------|----------|-------------|
| `--profile` | `default` | No | AWS config profile name |
| `--duration` | `12h` | No | STS session duration |
| `--op-vault` | - | Yes | 1Password vault name |
| `--op-item` | - | Yes | 1Password item name |
| `--op-access-key-id-field` | `Access key ID` | No | Field name for Access Key ID |
| `--op-secret-access-key-field` | `Secret access key` | No | Field name for Secret Access Key |
| `--op-cli-path` | `op` | No | Path to 1Password CLI |
| `--mfa-process` | - | No | Shell command to obtain an MFA code instead of prompting on /dev/tty |

### Cache

Temporary credentials are cached at `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/op-aws-credential-process/<profile>.json` (defaults to `~/.cache/op-aws-credential-process/<profile>.json`).
